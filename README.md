This is the result of working on a project over the last six weeks of the spring term. This project's goal was to evaluate student understanding of C++, design patterns, and large (for a student) multi-file projects through the creation of a basic text editor approximating Vim or EMacs, but with substantially less features. The scope of the project as split over three milestones with each being progressively more difficult than the last. At each milestone a report was to be submitted with code which would be tested to determine whether feature requirements for that milestone had been met.

The scope, the requirements, and the lack of support all culminated in making this was the most daunting and difficult project I had ever worked on. I welcomed the challenge, but as I found out, it is so easy to lose yourself in the details that you forget the broader picture of what you're trying to achieve. I experienced this implementing the requirement for paging on the second milestone. I had to go back to the drawing board (quite literally a whiteboard) to diagram out alternative approaches I could try. So much effort went toward this that the result was a buggy, laggy mess. Additional time spent before the final milestone was due contributed in bloating the design further. Such as it is, the editor is in an unusable state, but the project served as a good learning experience.
